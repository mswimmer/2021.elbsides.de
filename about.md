[Security BSides](http://securitybsides.com) events are organized by local computer security experts for the benefit of the local community. It is a way of bringing in speakers who may not ordinarily visit our community and it's a way of bringing the community together. 

Elbsides is derived from the successful [HH.Security](https://www.meetup.com/hh-security/) Meetup and some of the organizers of [BSidesMunich](http://bsidesmunich.org). This is the first time this conference is taking place, but with a team experienced in organizing events and conferences, it is going to be a success.
